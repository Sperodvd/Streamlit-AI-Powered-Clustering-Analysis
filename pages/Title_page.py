## Overview

This application enables users to explore, visualize, and analyze datasets using advanced clustering techniques and LLM-powered insights. 
The app is designed to serve as an initial phases of data analysis, providing users with a comprehensive initial view of their datasets.

### Key Features

- **Flexible Data Input:**  
  Upload your own CSV files or select from built-in sample datasets (Mall Customers Segmentation, Wine Dataset Clustering) for instant analysis.

- **Data Preview & Cleaning:**  
  Preview the first few rows of the dataset and display column information. Automatically detect missing values and choose how to handle them: drop rows/columns, fill with zeros or means, or leave as is.

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Generate a variety of visualizations, including:
  - Pairplots for exploring relationships between variables
  - Correlation heatmaps for understanding feature interdependencies
  - Histograms (with multi-column support and subplot arrangement) for distribution analysis  
  Two visualizations can be displayed side-by-side for easy comparison.

- **Clustering Analysis:**  
  - **Variable Selection:** Choose which numeric variables to include or exclude from clustering.
  - **Elbow Method & KElbow Visualizer:** Determine the optimal number of clusters using both inertia plots and Yellowbrickâ€™s KElbow Visualizer.
  - **Clustering Execution:** Run K-Means clustering and visualize the results in 2D using PCA.
  - **Cluster Profiles:** View the average feature values for each cluster.
  - **Silhouette Score:** Evaluate clustering quality with this metric.

- **AI-Powered Summarization:**  
  After clustering, a dedicated Data Scientist AI-Agent, powered by Groq API (utilizing the Llama 3 8B LLM), will analyze cluster profiles and silhouette scores and interprets the key insights, presenting the findings in a clear and accessible manner for the user. The app caches LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls.
